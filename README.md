# Getting Started with Expo init

This project was initialized with expo init (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `expo start`

When you run expo start (or npm start), Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app.
